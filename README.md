# AV_EDR_EPP_Notes

This project aims to document some of the AV/EDR (and perhaps more) encounters I've had in my red teaming career. I'll be noting observations and countermeasures I've observed or devised. Hopefully, this can be helpful to other red team operators (or maybe even malware developers, haha).

------

Within this project, I plan to document some basic information such as:

- Windows API Hook List
- Process information, registry information, driver services
- Detection blind spots
- Registered callback information

If you have any better suggestions, you can submit them to me through issues, and I will work on this in my spare time.
